Scope note:
This class comprises physical objects purposely created by human activity.

No assumptions are made as to the extent of modification required to justify regarding an object as human-made. For example, an inscribed piece of rock or a preserved butterfly are both regarded as instances of E22 Human-Made Object.


Examples:
- Mallard (the World?s fastest steam engine) (Solomon, 2003)
- the Portland Vase (Walker, 2004)
- the Coliseum (Hopkins, 2005)
